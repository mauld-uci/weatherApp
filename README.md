Atmosphere is a personalized weather app that learns your climate preference, and predicts how you will feel outside.


## What it Does  
How it feels outside is a subjective experience. Yet weather forecasts present the data numerically, making it difficult to determine how you might actually feel. How someone feels can also be affected by many different variables: wind chill, humidity, and cloud coverage, to name a few.  

Atmosphere seeks to address these issues by learning what climate the user prefers, and offering a "comfort assessment," that predicts how the user might feel outside. By asking a simple question, "How do you feel today?" Atmosphere takes the numbers out of weather.

#### Daily Forecast  

#### Comfort Ask  
Atmosphere is a personalized application, and so needs a personal touch. When the user is outside, Atmosphere will ask how they are feeling. Atmosphere remembers the input, and pairs it with various climate factors, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloud coverage. By collecting this data and analyzing trends, Atmosphere learns what kinds of climates the user prefers, and informs them if the coming day will be warm, cold, or exactly how they like.

There are two types of comfort asks: Check-Ins and Corrections. Check-Ins periodically occur to ask the user how they are feeling at a given moment. These will occur at launch without a user request. Corrections occur when a user disagrees with Atmosphere's comfort assessment.

#### What to Wear  
Atmosphere intelligently suggests outfit options based on its comfort assessment. At a glance, a user can determine whether they should wear shorts or a parka. On sunny days, Atmosphere will remind the user to bring sunglasses and sunscreen. On rainy days, Atmosphere will suggest a raincoat or umbrella. This at-a-glance feature simplifies the morning routine.

## How it Works  

#### Learning  
Atmosphere uses statistical analysis to determine how a user might feel given a certain climate. The data collection process ensures that Atmosphere's reccomendations will improve over time. When a user settles into a routine, over a long period of consistent weather, Atmosphere reduces comfort asks for convenience.  
But people tend to move around and adapt, and Atmosphere accounts for these changes as well. Drastic climate shifts and location changes will prompt more comfort asks, to improve analysis.
